# Architecture

## Architecture Style

This project follows a Python package-first architecture.

The core package is the center of the system.

External interfaces such as CLI, Skill, MCP, API, and frontend are adapters.

## Target Architecture

```text
Frontend / Web / Tauri
        ↓
FastAPI Backend
        ↓
MCP Server / CLI / Skill
        ↓
Python Core Package
        ↓
Review Rules / AI Adapter / Diff / Reports
```

---

## Current Architecture

Current phase only includes:

```text
Python Core Package
CLI
Docs
Tasks
Tests
```

MCP, Skill, API, and frontend are planned but not implemented yet.

The current core package input layer includes:

```text
src/content_review_engine/parser/
src/content_review_engine/config/
src/content_review_engine/review/
src/content_review_engine/rules/
profiles/
```

---

## Core Package Responsibility

The core package should handle:

- Markdown input processing
- Review profile loading
- Review pipeline coordination
- Rule execution
- Structured review findings and results
- Report generation
- Diff generation
- AI review adapter in later versions

Current implemented input helpers:

- `content_review_engine.parser.read_markdown`
- `content_review_engine.config.load_profile`
- `content_review_engine.rules.check_forbidden_terms`
- `content_review_engine.review.review_document`

Current CLI adapter:

```text
content-review review <markdown_file> --profile <profile_file>
```

Current CLI flow:

```text
CLI
 ↓
Markdown Reader
 ↓
Profile Loader
 ↓
Review Pipeline
 ↓
Deterministic Rules
 ↓
Review Result
```

The CLI currently supports reviewing one Markdown file with one YAML profile.
It prints a simple human-readable summary and does not yet support JSON, HTML, batch review, or report persistence.

Current deterministic rules:

- `forbidden_terms`

Current review pipeline:

- `review_document()` accepts already-loaded Markdown text and a loaded `ReviewProfile`.
- The pipeline runs deterministic rules in memory.
- The pipeline currently calls `forbidden_terms` directly and returns collected findings.

---

## Adapter Responsibility

Adapters should only call the core package.

Adapters include:

- CLI
- Skill
- MCP Server
- FastAPI backend
- Frontend

Adapters must not duplicate core review logic.

The CLI adapter only orchestrates existing helpers. It does not implement parsing, profile loading, or review rules itself.

---

## Forbidden Architecture

Do not do this:

```text
CLI contains review logic
MCP contains separate review prompt
API contains separate review pipeline
Skill contains business logic
```

Correct design:

```text
Markdown Reader
    ↓
Profile Loader
    ↓
Review Pipeline
    ↓
Deterministic Rules
    ↓
Review Result / Findings
```

Current adapter boundary:

```text
CLI / MCP / API / Skill
        ↓
content_review_engine core package
```

The current implementation includes a minimal CLI adapter, but still does not include LLM review, API, MCP, persistence, or frontend layers.
