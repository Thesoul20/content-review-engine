# PROJECT_STATE.md

## Current Phase

M1: Core input layer and minimal review pipeline.

The project currently has Markdown input handling, profile loading, deterministic review rules, and a minimal in-memory review pipeline on top of the initial data models.

---

## Completed

- Project direction is defined as a Python package-first content review engine.
- Long-term extension targets are identified:
  - CLI
  - Skill
  - MCP
  - FastAPI backend
  - Frontend
- Development will use task-based Agent workflow.
- Repository memory will be stored in project files, not in chat history.
- Initial core data models are in place.
- Markdown reader and YAML profile loading have been implemented.
- The first deterministic review rule has been implemented.
- A minimal review pipeline has been implemented.

---

## In Progress

- No active implementation task.

---

## Next Tasks

1. Add additional deterministic review rules.
2. Extend the review pipeline with more deterministic rules.

---

## Open Questions

- Final package name has not been frozen.
- CLI command name has not been frozen.
- PydanticAI integration is planned but not part of M0.
- MCP integration is planned but not part of M0.

## Do Not Change Yet

### Test Result

`uv run pytest` passed.

### Next Recommended Task

TASK-0005: Add Minimal Review Pipeline.

### Notes

No CLI, MCP, Skill, API, database, frontend, PydanticAI, Markdown parser, or review rule code was added.
`tests/test_models.py` now imports `content_review_engine` normally, with pytest configured to include `src/` on the import path.
The core package now includes one deterministic rule: `forbidden_terms`.
