# PROJECT_STATE.md

## Current Phase

M1: Core input layer and minimal review pipeline.

The project currently has Markdown input handling, profile loading, deterministic review rules, source location metadata on findings, and a minimal in-memory review pipeline on top of the initial data models.

---

## Completed

- Project direction is defined as a Python package-first content review engine.
- Long-term extension targets are identified:
  - CLI
  - Skill
  - MCP
  - FastAPI backend
  - Frontend
- Development will use task-based Agent workflow.
- Repository memory will be stored in project files, not in chat history.
- Initial core data models are in place.
- Markdown reader and YAML profile loading have been implemented.
- The first deterministic review rule has been implemented.
- A minimal review pipeline has been implemented.
- A minimal Markdown report renderer has been implemented.
- The CLI can export Markdown review reports.

---

## In Progress

- No active implementation task.

## Recent Completion

- TASK-0008 is complete.
- Added a Markdown review report renderer in `content_review_engine.reports`.
- The CLI now supports `--format markdown`.
- The CLI now supports `--output` for writing rendered reports to a file.
- Added tests for the Markdown report renderer and CLI Markdown output paths.
- TASK-0007 is complete.
- Added source location metadata to review findings.
- The forbidden terms rule now reports matched text, line, column, character offsets, and a context snippet.
- The CLI now prints location-aware text output and JSON output with nested location objects.
- The project still does not have LLM review, API, MCP, persistence, frontend, diff tracking, or rewriting support.

---

## Next Tasks

1. Add additional deterministic review rules.
2. Extend the review pipeline with more deterministic rules.

---

## Open Questions

- Final package name has not been frozen.
- CLI command name has not been frozen.
- PydanticAI integration is planned but not part of M0.
- MCP integration is planned but not part of M0.

## Do Not Change Yet

- Do not add MCP server yet.
- Do not add Skill yet.
- Do not add FastAPI yet.
- Do not add Supabase yet.
- Do not add frontend yet.

### Test Result

`uv run pytest` passed.

### Next Recommended Task

TASK-0008: Add a second deterministic review rule or expand the core review metadata further.

### Notes

`tests/test_models.py` now imports `content_review_engine` normally, with pytest configured to include `src/` on the import path.
The core package now includes one deterministic rule: `forbidden_terms`.
